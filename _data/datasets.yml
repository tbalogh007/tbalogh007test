      The US Sentencing Commission puts out a yearly report which includes every sentence
      which was meted out in the federal court system. USSC puts these files out in a
      very non-standard fixed-width format along with SAS and SPSS programs to read them into
      those programs.
      </p><p>
      This is a straight translation of these fixed-width files into CSVs for consumption
      in other environments.
