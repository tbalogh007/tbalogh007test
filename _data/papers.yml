    publishedat: Nature (in press)
    description: An RCT on the effects of different messages encouraging people to get vaccinated. We find that several weeks after vaccinations were available to all study participants, no particular message has any significant effect on vaccine uptake.
  - title: "Early Alert Systems During a Pandemic: A Simulation Study on the Impact of Concept Drift"

    coauthors: Paul Xu
    publishedat: LAK'21
    description: Early Alert Systems are quickly becoming commonplace in the educational space, especially for predicting drop out. We explore potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the quality of data these models receive and what the impacts on their predictions may be.

    coauthors: Ali Altug, Arul Shankar, Ila Varma
    publishedat: Journal of the European Mathematical Society. Volume 23.

    coauthors: Peter C. Casey and David Yokum
    publishedat: MUD3 @ SIGKDD'18
    description: We attempt to find rats in the District of Columbia using machine learning and subject matter expertise from urban rodentology. We do well at predicting 311 calls, but much less well at extrapolation. We provide a framework for field studies for machine learning models.
  - title: Using Machine Learning to Assess the Risk of and Prevent Water Main Breaks

    publishedat: SIGKDD'18
    description: We build a model to predict which water mains will break in the coming year in Syracuse, NY. We perform quite well, and the model is being used to guide proactive water main repair.
  - title: "Estimating student proficiency: Deep is not the panacea"

    coauthors: Yan Karklin, Bojian Han, and Chaitu Ekanadham
    publishedat: EDM'16
    description: We show that the original Deep Knowledge Tracing paper is fundamentally flawed and that, after correcting its errors, that DKT is outperformed by a simple hierarchical model on multiple data sets.
